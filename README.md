# Salary Prediction Project

## Introduction:
This collaborative project is our entry for the third data science course competition. Our goal is to predict salaries using a provided dataset. This project showcases our skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

## Dataset:
We work with a dataset containing salary-related information. It includes features such as experience, education, and job type to predict salaries.

## Approach:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We delved into the dataset to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand feature relationships.

## Feature Engineering: To enhance model performance, we engineered relevant features, considering various techniques.

## Model Selection: Multiple regression algorithms were experimented with, including Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## Evaluation: Models were evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error. The model with the best performance was selected.

## Results:
Our final model achieved [mention performance metric]. We validated assumptions and visualized predictions for practical use.

### Team Effort:
This project was a collaborative effort among [names of team members]. Each member contributed to EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and result analysis.

## Conclusion:
Through teamwork, this project has enriched our skills in real-world data analysis, modeling, and collaboration. We anticipate presenting our findings and gaining insights from our peers.
